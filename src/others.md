1. runtime performance: how long/memory, GPU?
2. side by side comparison
3. resources other than paper
4. drawbacks

## Ours
1. Title video Snapcut
   a paper from UofM and adobe system, AE's rotobrush, patent, no avaliable code. However, 2 github repos, but none of them runnable
2. env: opencv + qt, use opencv's geometric and optical flow
3. our parallelism: std::thread on a 4-core machine
